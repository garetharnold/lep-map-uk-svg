# Local Enterprise Partnerships Map (.svg)

SVG map of Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEP) in the United Kingdom. For any souls out there who need a to create interactive maps using LEP areas in the UK, I hope this can serve as a basis to help you. 

The bulk of it is ripped from the Office for National Statistics but it was poorly constructed so I had to remake certain areas of it.

Good luck with whatever creative solutions you have for dealing with overlapping area boundaries.
